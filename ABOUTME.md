# About Me

## Name
**Divyanshu Sharma**
*Developer | B.Tech IT '25*

## Summary
I graduated from AKGEC in 2025 with an engineering degree in IT. I have been working with mobile applications mostly, creating both the frontend and backend. I also create web apps from time to time, and while I leverage AI to build things quickly, I keep full control over the code and architecture. I'm someone who can figure things out on my own and doesn't need handholding.

For **Aggroso**, I used **Next.js 15**, **Prisma**, **PostgreSQL (Neon)**, and **Gemini 2.0** to build an efficient tool for meeting notes. The project involved solving real deployment challenges like migrating from SQLite to PostgreSQL for cloud compatibility.
